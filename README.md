# Digital Crafts Coding Assessment

When I spoke to Harmony over the phone, she mentioned that one of the most important things about this assessment was making sure it was teachable.

I felt like I missed out on working with apis in my bootcamp. 

This would make a great code along that can be added to at a later date.

This portion would have them manipulating the dom and communicating with a thrid party api.

They could get the app deployed using netlify drop. 

Then, later when they learned node, they could revisit this exercise and use a package like dotenv to store their api key in an environtment variable. 

After that, they could deploy the app to heroku and learn about setting up an environement variable in a deploy.
